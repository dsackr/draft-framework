# Drafting Sessions

## What A Drafting Session Is

A Drafting Session is a machine-readable record of partial architecture work.

Use it when the Draftsman or a human architect has enough information to start
building DRAFT content, but not enough to finish every downstream object in one
pass.

The point of the session object is to preserve:

- what the session was trying to build
- what source material informed the work
- what YAML objects were created or proposed
- what assumptions were made so progress could continue
- what questions remain open
- what next steps should be revisited later

This is the framework object that makes prompts like “let’s address open DRAFT
questions for TX-ERP” possible without relying on chat history.

## When To Use One

Create a Drafting Session when:

- source material is incomplete or ambiguous
- a diagram or intake only partially answers the needed questions
- the Draftsman must make best-effort guesses to keep going
- downstream stubs or provisional objects are created
- unresolved questions need to be revisited later in a structured way

Do not use a Drafting Session as a replacement for an SDM, RA, or RBB. It is a
working object that wraps incomplete authoring state.

## YAML Shape

The authoritative schema is
[drafting-session.schema.yaml](../schemas/drafting-session.schema.yaml).

At minimum, a Drafting Session includes:

- `id`
- `type: drafting_session`
- `name`
- `sessionStatus`
- `primaryObjectType`
- `sourceArtifacts`
- `generatedObjects`
- `unresolvedQuestions`

Common optional fields include:

- `primaryObjectId`
- `assumptions`
- `nextSteps`
- `architecturalDecisions`

## How To Use It

The normal pattern is:

1. Start the session from a partial source such as a Confluence page, Visio,
   spreadsheet, or interview.
2. Create or update the target architecture objects with best-effort answers.
3. Record the generated or stubbed objects in `generatedObjects`.
4. Record open questions with their current best guess and impact in
   `unresolvedQuestions`.
5. Record follow-up work in `nextSteps`.

That keeps the draft moving without pretending uncertainty does not exist.

## Relationship To SDMs

Drafting Sessions are especially useful for SDMs because SDM authoring often
starts before all downstream runtime details are known.

In that case:

- the SDM can still be created and validated
- provisional assumptions can be made explicit
- unresolved runtime questions can be tracked outside the SDM itself

This prevents the SDM from turning into a dumping ground for half-finished
notes while still preserving the work that remains.
