# Workspaces

## Operating Model

DRAFT separates the upstream framework from private company implementation
content. A company workspace vendors a reviewed framework copy into its own
repo so normal Draftsman use is private, deterministic, and reviewable.

The upstream framework repo owns:

- `framework/schemas/` for object contracts
- `framework/configurations/` for base capabilities, Requirement Groups, domains,
  and object-patchable configuration
- `framework/tools/` for validation and generation
- `templates/` for object and company repo templates
- `examples/catalog/` for demonstration content only
- `docs/index.html` for the generated static GitHub Pages browser

A company private DRAFT repo owns:

- `.draft/framework/` for the vendored framework copy used by that company
- `.draft/providers/` for optional third-party DRAFT requirement packs
- `.draft/workspace.yaml` for tracked workspace metadata
- `.draft/framework.lock` for the reviewed upstream framework source and synced commit
- `catalog/` for architecture content
- `configurations/` for company capability mappings, Requirement Groups, and object patches

The effective model is resolved in this order:

1. vendored framework base configuration from `.draft/framework/configurations/`
2. optional third-party provider configurations from `.draft/providers/*/configurations/`
3. workspace configuration overlays
4. workspace catalog content

The public `dsackr/draft-framework` repository is an update source, not a
runtime dependency for company drafting. DRAFT Table reads the vendored copy in
`.draft/framework/` during normal use. A company chooses when to refresh that
copy, reviews the resulting Git diff, validates the workspace, and commits the
framework refresh in its private repo.

Company overrides should be represented as `object_patch` YAML when the goal is
to alter a base framework object without editing the vendored framework copy.
Patch files live under `configurations/object-patches/`.

Workspace requirement activation lives in `.draft/workspace.yaml`, not in the
presence of YAML files. A framework, provider, or company may publish many
workspace-mode Requirement Groups, but the company must explicitly activate the
groups it architects against:

```yaml
requirements:
  activeRequirementGroups:
    - <soc2-requirement-group-uid>
    - <company-roper-requirement-group-uid>
  requireActiveRequirementGroupDisposition: false
```

`requireActiveRequirementGroupDisposition: false` allows existing inventory to migrate
incrementally. Draftsman still uses active groups for new and updated
objects. Setting it to `true` makes validation require every in-scope object to
record disposition against every active group.

Framework base capability files ship with empty `implementations` and a
`definitionOwner`. Company workspaces own the capability `owner` and the mapping
from capability to approved Technology Components by adding capability overlays
or object patches under `configurations/`. Validation requires `owner.team` in
the effective capability whenever implementations are assigned.

The distinction matters:

- `definitionOwner` says who maintains the capability definition and vocabulary.
- `owner` says which company team can approve lifecycle disposition for vendor
  products that satisfy the capability.
- `implementations` list only Technology Components, because lifecycle
  disposition applies to a discrete vendor product and version.

## Business Taxonomy

Companies can declare their own business pillars, portfolios, or product
groupings in `.draft/workspace.yaml`. The framework does not ship company
business taxonomy values; it only validates and renders the workspace values
when Software Deployment Patterns reference them.

Example:

```yaml
businessTaxonomy:
  requireSoftwareDeploymentPatternPillar: true
  pillars:
    - id: business-pillar.human-capital-management
      name: Human Capital Management
      owner:
        team: hcm-product
        contact: hcm-product@example.com
    - id: business-pillar.student-management
      name: Student Management
    - id: business-pillar.business-operations
      name: Business Operations
```

Software Deployment Patterns reference those values through
`businessContext.pillar`. Use `businessContext.additionalPillars` only when a
pattern materially spans more than one business pillar; the primary `pillar`
drives browser grouping.

## Authoring Workflow

The default workspace workflow is source based:

1. Create or update YAML in `catalog/` or `configurations/`.
2. Use the matching template from `.draft/framework/templates/` when creating a new object.
3. Read the relevant schema and Requirement Group before filling in fields.
4. Preserve unresolved facts in `catalog/sessions/` as Drafting Sessions.
5. Run `python3 .draft/framework/tools/validate.py --workspace /path/to/workspace`.
6. Review and commit the workspace changes through normal Git workflow.

Direct YAML files are the source of truth. Generated files such as
`docs/index.html` and `AI_INDEX.md` are derived from source content.

## Catalog Browsing

The Architecture browser is generated by
`framework/tools/generate_browser.py`. In this upstream framework repository it
renders `framework/configurations/` plus `examples/catalog/` into
`docs/index.html` for GitHub Pages.

For a company repo, generate a browser from that workspace explicitly:

```bash
python3 .draft/framework/tools/generate_browser.py \
  --workspace /path/to/company-draft-workspace \
  --output /path/to/output/index.html
```

The generated browser is read-only. Catalog changes are made in YAML and then
validated.

The browser's Acceptable Use Technology view is generated from the effective
Capability model. It groups Technology Component lifecycle mappings by domain,
shows which capability each product satisfies, and lists the company capability
owner/contact for change requests.

## Framework Updates

Framework updates are explicit. The workspace records the upstream source and
synced commit in `.draft/framework.lock`, while the actual framework files live
under `.draft/framework/`.

The normal refresh flow is:

1. Update the installed framework checkout or choose a reviewed internal mirror.
2. Run `draft-table framework status` to see the currently vendored commit.
3. Run `draft-table framework refresh` to replace `.draft/framework/` from the selected source.
4. Validate the workspace against the refreshed framework.
5. Review and commit the `.draft/framework/` and `.draft/framework.lock` changes.

Company-specific changes should remain in top-level `configurations/` as
overlays or object patches. Avoid editing `.draft/framework/` directly unless
the intent is to maintain an internal fork of the framework.

New workspaces also include an optional GitHub Actions workflow at
`.github/workflows/draft-framework-update.yml`. The workflow checks for a newer
DRAFT Framework version tag, opens an update branch, refreshes
`.draft/framework/`, updates `.draft/framework.lock`, and validates the
workspace.

When validation passes, the workflow opens a normal update pull request. When
validation fails, it opens the pull request anyway with a blocked title and the
validation output in the body. The branch remains available for the company or
the Draftsman to repair catalog and configuration issues against the new
framework version. Disable the workflow in GitHub Actions or delete the file if
the company wants to manage framework updates manually.

## Deployable Architecture Direction

The end goal is deployable architecture. Catalog objects should capture facts
that can later inform pipeline and infrastructure automation:

- Hosts, Runtime Services, Data-at-Rest Services, Edge/Gateway Services, and
  Product Services describe reusable deployable building blocks.
- Reference Architectures describe deployable patterns.
- Software Deployment Patterns describe product deployment reality.
- Capabilities describe architecture outcomes, company decision owners, and
  approved Technology Component implementations.
- Requirement Groups describe required authoring and compliance answers.
- Future automation mappings can translate approved objects into pipeline and
  IaC inputs.

When an AI agent has a choice between vague narrative and structured deployable
facts, it should choose structured deployable facts and preserve missing details
as validation gaps or drafting-session questions.
