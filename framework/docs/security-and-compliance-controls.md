# Security And Compliance Requirement Groups

## What This Layer Does

DRAFT treats compliance as an explicitly activated authoring and validation layer.
The layer is implemented with `requirement_group` objects using
`activation: workspace`.

The presence of a requirement group YAML file does not make it active. A company
activates the groups it architects against in `.draft/workspace.yaml`:

```yaml
requirements:
  activeRequirementGroups:
    - requirement-group.draft-soc2
    - requirement-group.company-roper
  requireActiveRequirementGroupDisposition: false
```

`requireActiveRequirementGroupDisposition: false` allows existing inventory to
migrate incrementally. Draftsman still asks active-group questions for new and
updated objects. Setting it to `true` makes validation require every approved
in-scope object to record disposition for every active workspace-mode group.

## Provider And Authority

A workspace-mode Requirement Group may be authored by the framework, a company,
or a third-party provider. Use `provider` to identify who authored the DRAFT
mapping and `authority` to identify the external source or program.

Examples:

- `requirement-group.draft-soc2` is a DRAFT Framework-provided mapping for SOC 2.
- `requirement-group.company-roper` would be a company-owned internal control group.
- A provider pack can publish `requirement-group.vendor-soc2` without replacing
  the framework-provided SOC 2 interpretation.

The framework maintains its included DRAFT-provided mappings as starter
architecture aids. It does not claim that using them makes a company compliant
with SOC 2, NIST CSF, TX-RAMP, or any external program. The authority remains
the auditor, regulator, control owner, or company compliance program.

## Object-Level Evidence

Objects use `requirementGroups` to claim a workspace-mode group and
`requirementImplementations` to record evidence:

- `satisfied`: the object has a valid answer for the requirement
- `not-applicable`: the requirement permits N/A and the object records that disposition
- `not-compliant`: the gap is known and must remain visible until fixed

When a requirement has `relatedCapability`, the Draftsman resolves the capability
object, reads the company capability owner, and recommends `preferred` or
`existing-only` Technology Component implementations before asking the user. This
means compliance questions are grounded in the same capability model as base
object-definition questions.

## Overlap With Base Requirements

Workspace-mode control requirements often overlap with always-on base
requirements. This is intentional. A base requirement establishes that an
architecture object is complete and supportable; a control requirement
establishes that the object has a specific compliance disposition.

The requirements stay separate even when they share the same
`relatedCapability`. The Draftsman should ask once by capability, reuse the
same evidence where valid, and record each active control requirement's
disposition independently. The stricter requirement determines what additional
facts must be gathered. For example, base log management may only need the
logging destination, while a control requirement may also need retention,
review, alerting, or evidence-protection details.

Marking a control requirement `not-applicable` does not make the matching base
requirement disappear. It only records the disposition for that specific
workspace-mode requirement.

## Browser Behavior

The GitHub Pages browser is read-only. It shows Requirement Groups as framework
content and shows declared requirement groups on object detail pages. It does
not provide a runtime compliance display filter or selector. Activation is a
build-time workspace configuration decision in `.draft/workspace.yaml`.
