# DRAFT v1.0 Readiness Roadmap

This roadmap tracks the remaining MVP work needed to move DRAFT from a credible
architecture catalog framework to a version 1.0 deployable architecture
platform.

The v1.0 goal is narrow and concrete: a Draftsman conversation should produce a
complete, compliant, reviewable architecture graph that can be translated into a
deployment plan without hiding operational or security gaps.

v1.0 is repo-first. It will not launch with a required DRAFT app, hosted
service, or DRAFT-specific CLI. A company should be able to connect its
preferred AI tool to a company DRAFT repo and have that AI become the
Draftsman by reading the repo bootstrap files and vendored framework copy.

## Tracking Model

Track execution in GitHub with:

- milestone: `v1.0`
- core labels: `v1.0`, `mvp`
- area labels: `deployment`, `automation`, `catalog`, `compliance`,
  `draftsman`

The canonical v1.0 work items are GitHub issues #3, #4, and #5. Keep this file
as the stable narrative and use GitHub Issues for execution, discussion, and
ownership.

## Issue 1: v1.0: executable deployment contract

Problem:

DRAFT currently captures deployable architecture facts, but deployable is still
mostly a semantic promise. The framework needs one explicit path from approved
DRAFT objects to a generated deployment plan.

MVP outcome:

Define a minimal executable deployment contract that can translate one approved
Software Deployment Pattern graph into a deployment manifest and dry-run plan.

Acceptance criteria:

- Add a machine-readable deployment target and environment binding contract.
- Generate a deployment manifest from an approved Software Deployment Pattern
  and its closed deployable object graph.
- Add one narrow adapter path for dry-run output, even if the first adapter only
  emits a neutral plan format rather than applying infrastructure.
- Block deployment plan generation when the graph contains unresolved Drafting
  Session questions, invalid references, not-compliant requirements, or
  unapproved required objects.
- Represent secrets only as references, never as literal values.
- Add validator coverage and documentation for the contract.

Recommended labels: `v1.0`, `mvp`, `deployment`, `automation`

## Issue 2: v1.0: complete golden reference workspace

Problem:

The framework has strong schemas, Requirement Groups, and validation logic, but
the example catalog does not yet prove a complete product deployment path with
compliance evidence.

MVP outcome:

Ship one complete golden workspace that demonstrates the intended DRAFT loop end
to end.

Acceptance criteria:

- Include Technology Components, Host, Runtime Service, Data-at-Rest Service,
  Edge/Gateway Service, Product Service, Reference Architecture, Software
  Deployment Pattern, Decision Record, and Drafting Session examples.
- Activate at least one workspace-mode security or compliance Requirement
  Group.
- Record valid `requirementImplementations` evidence for the active group.
- Demonstrate acceptable-use Technology Component mappings through
  capabilities.
- Ensure the golden workspace validates without warnings.
- Regenerate the browser so topology, relationships, requirements, evidence,
  and acceptable-use views can be inspected.
- Document how maintainers should use the golden workspace as a regression
  target for v1.0 changes.

Recommended labels: `v1.0`, `mvp`, `catalog`, `compliance`

## Issue 3: v1.0: deterministic Draftsman production workflow

Problem:

Production authoring depends on general-purpose AI tools connected to a repo.
The framework needs enough bootstrap instructions, templates, examples,
validation, and PR workflow guidance for those tools to behave as a deterministic
Draftsman without a DRAFT-specific app.

MVP outcome:

Make Draftsman output structured, reviewable, repairable, and safe enough for
governed company workspaces using ordinary AI coding tools and Git pull
requests.

Acceptance criteria:

- Replace opaque YAML proposal content with a structured proposal model that can
  be validated before writing files.
- Require schema-aware summaries and diffs before applying proposed changes.
- Map validation failures to actionable repair steps that the Draftsman can
  propose or perform.
- Record source provenance on every generated or materially updated artifact.
- Preserve Drafting Session state so interrupted work can resume without relying
  on chat history.
- Document the minimum supported Git branch, commit, push, and pull request
  path for connected AI tools using the user's credentials.
- Add tests that cover proposal validation, failed validation recovery,
  provenance capture, and resumable sessions.

Recommended labels: `v1.0`, `mvp`, `draftsman`, `compliance`

## Future Enhancements: DRAFT Table And CLI

The local DRAFT Table app and `draft-table` CLI are useful prototypes, but they
are not part of the v1.0 launch promise. Keep them available for experiments,
but do not make onboarding, authoring, or validation depend on them.

Future work may revive the app as optional convenience tooling for:

- guided source upload and document extraction
- visual proposal review cards
- local validation repair loops
- local provider configuration and diagnostics
- commit and pull request helpers
- framework refresh helpers

Until then, the canonical workflow is the repo plus the user's chosen AI tool.
