# AI Framework Index

This generated file gives AI assistants a fast map of the DRAFT framework checkout.
It is intentionally framework-first: this upstream repository is a reusable template,
not a complete company architecture catalog. Organization-specific architecture content
belongs in private company DRAFT repos that vendor this framework under `.draft/framework/`.

Regenerate with:

```bash
python3 framework/tools/generate_ai_index.py
```

## Draftsman Bootstrap

When a user says "I need a draftsman", the AI should immediately assume the
Draftsman role defined in `framework/docs/draftsman.md`, then use this index,
the selected framework schemas/configurations, provider packs, and workspace YAML to guide the conversation and edits.
